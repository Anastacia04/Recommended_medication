# Recommended_medication
In modern healthcare, prescribing medication requires clinicians to analyze multiple
factors simultaneously, such as symptoms, allergies, chronic conditions, demographic
information, and medical history.Choosing an inappropriate treatment can lead to ad-
verse reactions or reduced effectiveness.The aim of this project is to develop a machine-
learning system capable of recommending the most suitable medication based on pa-
tient characteristics. This task is formulated as a multiclass classification problem with
four possible outcomes: amlodipine, ibuprofen, amoxicillin, or no medication.

The dataset, sourced from the Personalized Medication Dataset on Kaggle, contains
1,000 patients described by 17 features. It includes demographic information (age,
gender, weight, height, BMI), medical history (chronic conditions, allergies, genetic
disorders), and detailed symptom descriptions.
